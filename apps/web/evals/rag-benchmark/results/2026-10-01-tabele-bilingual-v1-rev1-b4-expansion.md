# RAG benchmark — tabele-bilingual-v1 v1

Run on **2026-10-01** against commit `bc8c47741`.

Every figure in this corpus was invented for it and exists nowhere else, so a
correct answer is evidence that retrieval worked rather than that the model
remembered. The control column is the same model answering the same question
with no documents attached — the floor the pipeline has to beat.

## Stack under test

| | |
|---|---|
| chat model | `gemini-3-flash-preview` |
| judge model | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| rephrase model | `mistral-small-3.2` |
| embeddings | `bge-multilingual-gemma2` (3584-dim) |
| reranking | on for the organization; FEATURE_FLAG_RERANKING=1 in the runner's environment (the server's is not visible) — `scaleway` / `qwen3-embedding-8b` |
| post-retrieval, as the server reported it | `reranker:scaleway + neighbours` × 18 |
| multi-query variants | on, 1 variant per turn (code constant) |
| ingest shape | b4-expansion |
| LLM path | `(unknown: healthcheck did not say)` |

## Evidence recall (RAG arm)

Of the figures each question's assertions look for, how many were in the
chunks the server says it gave the answer model — read back from the
`retrieval` event's trace. Low evidence with a low pass rate is a
retrieval miss; high evidence with a low pass rate is the answer.

| | evidence found |
|---|---|
| all questions | 13/18 (72%); all evidence in context 12/17 |
| same language | 10/13 (77%); all evidence in context 9/12 |
| cross-lingual | 3/5 (60%); all evidence in context 3/5 |
| type: numeric | 7/9 (78%); all evidence in context 7/9 |
| type: multi-hop | 2/3 (67%); all evidence in context 1/2 |
| type: cross-lingual | 3/5 (60%); all evidence in context 3/5 |
| type: guard-hallucination | — |
| type: guard-sycophancy | 1/1 (100%); all evidence in context 1/1 |

## By document

Each question counts toward every document that holds its answer, including
questions that cited nothing; a guard question whose answer is in no document
is not counted. The RAG score is the one ingest wrote when this run uploaded it.

| document | RAG score | Ragen (RAG) | control (no retrieval) |

| `docs/pl-01-limity-sprzetowe.md` | failed | 2/3 (67%) | — |

| `docs/pl-03-rejestr-wytopow.xlsx` | failed | 1/2 (50%) | — |
| `docs/en-01-equipment-limits.md` | failed | 3/5 (60%) | — |
